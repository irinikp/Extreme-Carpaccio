Extreme Carpaccio
==============

In <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Heraklion-Software-Craftsmanship-Community/events/246829466/">this</a> Coding Game we separated in teams and played <a href="https://github.com/dlresende/extreme-carpaccio/tree/master/clients">this</a> game. 

I'm proud to say our team won, even though the fast implementation and slicing did not go together with the pretty code, but we gained much imaginary profit!

In our first (and bigger) slice we implemented functions country_tax() and compute_initial_sum() and we only replied when the amount was <1000. After that we started running our client. 

The overall profit was positive (therefore we had the money to keep working ;) ). As a next step we implemented compute_reduction_tax(). This improved our profit even more. 

Then we had enough time to handle error cases in separate slices and improve our responses accordingly. 

Here you can see our profits graph (team "Nikos") comparing to the rest of the teams <img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/1/c/b/600_467973227.jpeg" alt="image" width="50%" />
